                 <h5>Service call fee:</h5>
                 <p>The service call fee is the price to examine and diagnose problem(s) with one appliance based on the symptoms the appliance is having, and to provide a written estimate with parts (if needed) and labor to repair/service the issue(s). WE CHARGE A SEPARATE SERVICE CALL FEE FOR EACH APPLIANCE WE EXAMINE AND DIAGNOSE. THE SERVICE CALL FEE IS NON-REFUNDABLE. THE SERVICE CALL FEE MUST BE COLLECTED FROM THE CUSTOMER PRIOR TO, OR AT THE TIME OF INITITAL VISIT. </p>
            
                 <h5>Appointment(s):</h5>
                 <p>Our appointments have a 4 hour window. All appointments are set based on the earliest availability. Part installation appointments are not scheduled until the parts have arrived.</p>

                 <h5>Warranty</h5>
                 <p>Our limited labor warranty in regard to correcting defects in our workmanship is 60 days. If a part fails owing to a manufacturer's defect, however, our labor is covered for just 60 days. There is no warranty against additional or more extensive repairs, against other problems that may occur on the same machine (even if involving what appear to be identical symptoms), or against incidental damages. Parts carry the manufacturer's warranty, which is usually 30-90 days dependent on manufacturer.</p>
